        1. Attempt to parse _sourceText_ using _goalSymbol_ as the goal symbol, and analyse the parse result for any early error conditions. Parsing and early error detection may be interleaved in an implementation-defined manner.
        1. If the parse succeeded and no early errors were found, return the Parse Node (an instance of _goalSymbol_) at the root of the parse tree resulting from the parse.
        1. Otherwise, return a List of one or more *SyntaxError* objects representing the parsing errors and/or early errors. If more than one parsing error or early error is present, the number and ordering of error objects in the list is implementation-defined, but at least one must be present.
