            1. Assert: _A_ and _B_ each contain exactly one character.
            1. Let _a_ be the one character in CharSet _A_.
            1. Let _b_ be the one character in CharSet _B_.
            1. Let _i_ be the character value of character _a_.
            1. Let _j_ be the character value of character _b_.
            1. Assert: _i_ â‰¤ _j_.
            1. Return the CharSet containing all characters with a character value greater than or equal to _i_ and less than or equal to _j_.
