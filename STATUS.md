We apply [FSE'22 Artifact Evaluation](https://2022.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2022-artifacts)
for **Functional**, **Reusable**, and **Available** badges.  We believe that
researchers can utilize and freely extend our tool to perform meta-level static
analysis for JavaScript with diverse analysis techniques.  For reusability, we
wrote several documents including installation and commands for a new target
program.  For availability, we published our artifact as
a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/jsaver) and
a [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6668789).
