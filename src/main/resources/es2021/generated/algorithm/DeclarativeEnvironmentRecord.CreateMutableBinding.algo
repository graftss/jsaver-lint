            1. Assert: _envRec_ does not already have a binding for _N_.
            1. Create a mutable binding in _envRec_ for _N_ and record that it is uninitialized. If _D_ is *true*, record that the newly created binding may be deleted by a subsequent DeleteBinding call.
            1. Return NormalCompletion(~empty~).
